\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:prel}
\subsection{Graphs}
\label{sec:prel_graphs}
Throughout the paper, we assume that a graph is simple and undirected.
% We also assume that a \nonnegative integer $k$ is given. 
We also assume that each vertex $v$ is associated with a fixed
integer identifier $\id(v)$.
These identifiers are given as part of the input graph
and are preserved in all induced subgraphs.

For a graph $G=(V,E)$ with a vertex set $V$
and an edge set $E$,
we may abbreviate an edge $\{u,v\} \in E$ as $uv$ (or equivalently $vu$)
for simplicity.
% neighbours
For a vertex $v \in V$, we denote by $N_G(v)$ the set of \neighbours of $v$. 
Let $S \subseteq V$ be a subset of vertices.
We denote by $N_G(S) = \bigcup_{v \in S} N_G(v) \setminus S$,
% induced subgraph
the set of open \neighbours of $S$ in $G$.
We denote by $G[S]$ the subgraph of $G$
induced by $S$.
We denote by $G-S$ the subgraph obtained by
removing $S$ and all edges to incident to $S$,
that is, $G - S = G[V-S]$.
If $S = \{v\}$,
then we simply write $G-v$ instead of $G - \{v\}$.
% \maxTwoDegPath
A \emph{\maxTwoDegPath} in $G$ is a maximal path
whose vertices all have degree two in $G$.
Note that a \maxTwoDegPath may consist of a single vertex.

\subsection{DFS-Trees and Related Notions}
\label{sec:prel_dfs}
% DFS-Tree
A \emph{DFS-tree} of a connected undirected graph~$G = (V,E)$
is a spanning tree~$T$ obtained by performing a depth-first search (DFS) on $G$.
We root $T$ at an arbitrary vertex $r \in V$.
% Subtree
For each $v\in V$, we denote by $T_v$ the subtree of $T$
rooted at $v$.

An edge in $E$ is called a \emph{tree edge} if it appears in $T$,
and a \emph{back edge} otherwise.
%
For $u,v \in V$,
we say that $u$ is an \emph{ancestor} of $v$
if $u$ lies on the unique $r$--$v$ path in $T$.
Moreover, if $u$ is an ancestor of $v$ and $u \neq v$,
then we say that $u$ is a \emph{proper ancestor} of $v$,
and $v$ is correspondingly
a (\emph{proper}) \emph{descendant} of $u$.
If $uv$ is a tree edge and $u$ is an ancestor of $v$,
then $u$ is the \emph{parent} of $v$;
we denote this by $\pi(v)=u$.

% % DFS-index
% During the DFS,
% each vertex is assigned a unique integer called \emph{DFS-index},
% which records the order in which the DFS visits the vertices.
% For $v \in V$, we denote its DFS-index by $\mathit{dfsId}(v)$.
% Every vertex has a smaller DFS-index than any of its descendants.

% orientation of edges
We may orient edges based on the DFS-tree $T$:
for a tree edge $\pi(v)v$, we orient it from $\pi(v)$ to $v$; and
for a back edge $xy$, we orient it from the descendant to the ancestor.
We may write $(u,v)$ and $(x,y)$ to indicate the orientation of edge $uv$ and $xy$,
and refer to it as the \emph{outgoing edge} from $u$ or $x$
and the \emph{incoming edge} to $v$ or $y$.

%
We say that a tree edge $\pi(v)v$ is \emph{covered} by a back edge
$e=(x,y)$ if $x$ is a descendant of $v$ and
$y$ is a proper ancestor of $v$
(an ancestor of $\pi(v)$).
In this case, $e$ together with $\pi(v)v$ forms part of a cycle in $G$.
Note that every tree edge is covered by at least one back edge
if $G$ is 2-edge-connected.
For a tree edge $uv$, we denote by
$
\Cov(uv)=\{(x,y)\in E \mid (x,y)\ \text{is a back edge covering}\ uv\}
$
the set of back edges that cover $uv$.
We refer to $\CovMult(uv) \triangleq |\Cov(uv)|$ as the \emph{cover multiplicity}
of the tree edge $uv$.
% Furthermore, we define the \emph{cover-source multiplicity} of $uv$ to be
% $
% \CovSrc(uv)\triangleq \bigl|\{x \in V(T_v) \mid \text{There is } y \text{ s.t. } (x,y)\in \Cov(uv)\}\bigr|,
% $
% that is, the number of distinct descendants of $v$
% that serve as tails of back edges covering~$uv$.

In addition to cover multiplicity,
we also consider aggregated identifiers of endpoints of covering back edges.
For a tree edge $uv$ and $i \in \{1, 2\}$, we define
\[
\CovDesc{i}(uv) \triangleq \sum_{(x,y) \in \Cov(uv)} \left(\id(x)\right)^i,
\qquad
\CovAnc{i}(uv) \triangleq \sum_{(x,y) \in \Cov(uv)} \left(\id(y)\right)^i.
\]
We refer to these quantities as \emph{\aggIDs}.

% longest back edge outgoing from v
% For a vertex $x \in V$,
% every vertex~$y$ with a back edge $(x, y)$
% lies on the unique $\pi(x)$--$r$ path in $T$.
% Among such vertices~$y$,
% let  $y^*$ denote
% %  the one with the smallest DFS-index,
% % that is, 
% the one closest to the root $r$ in $T$.
% We call the back edge $x y^*$ the \emph{longest back edge outgoing from $x$}
% and denote it by $\lbe(x)$ and $y^*$ by $\lbeTarget(x)$.

\subsection{Graph Contraction and Suppression}
\label{sec:prel_contr_supp}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph.
% contraction
For $S \subseteq V$,
the \emph{contraction} of $S$ in $G$
is the graph obtained by
merging all vertices in $S$ into a single vertex $s$,
removing all edges with both endpoints in $S$,
and replacing each edge with one endpoint in $S$ by an edge incident to $s$.
% suppression
For a vertex $v \in V$ with degree two,
the \emph{suppression} of $v$ in $G$
is the graph obtained by
removing $v$ and its two incident edges,
and adding a new edge between the two \neighbours of $v$.
Equivalently, assuming that $v$ has two \neighbours $u$ and $w$,
we contract the set $\{u,v\}$ or $\{v,w\}$ in $G$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Cover Information on DFS-Trees}
\label{sec:cov_info}
% In this section,
% we study structural properties of cover information
% and present an efficient algorithm
% for computing various cover-related quantities.
For later use,
we present efficient algorithms
for computing various cover-related quantities
in this section.
% In \secref{cov_info_struct},
% we establish several structural properties of \aggIDs.
% Although these properties are not immediate from the definitions,
% they play a crucial role in the computation of MinRSs.
%
In \secref{diff_agg},
we introduce a general technique, called \emph{difference-based aggregation},
which efficiently supports path-based update operations on a rooted tree.
%
In \secref{cov_info_agg},
we apply this technique to compute various cover-related quantities
for all tree edges in a 2-edge-connected undirected graph
in $O(n+m)$ time.

Before presenting the algorithms,
we briefly illustrate how \aggIDs
can be used to detect structural properties
of covering back edges.
%
For a tree edge $uv$,
we can determine whether all covering back edges
outgo from the same descendant or
ingo to the same ancestor
using the \aggIDs.
%
In order to show this,
we first prove a general lemma on sequences of real numbers.

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:seq_all_equal}
  Let $(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_q)$ be a sequence of $q$ real numbers.
  Then, all elements in the sequence are equal, i.e.,
  $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \cdots = \alpha_q$,
  if and only if
  \[
  \left(\sum_{i=1}^{q} \alpha_i\right)^2 = q  \sum_{i=1}^{q} \left(\alpha_i\right)^2.
  \]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  We have
  \begin{align*}
    &q \sum_{i=1}^{q} \left(\alpha_i\right)^2
    - \left(\sum_{i=1}^{q} \alpha_i\right)^2
    = \sum_{i=1}^{q} (q-1)\left(\alpha_i\right)^2
    - \sum_{i=1}^{q-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{q} 2 \alpha_i \alpha_j 
    \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{q} (q-i + i -1)\left(\alpha_i\right)^2
    - \sum_{i=1}^{q-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{q} 2 \alpha_i \alpha_j
    \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{q-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{q} \left(\alpha_i\right)^2
    + \sum_{i=2}^{q} \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \left(\alpha_i\right)^2
    - \sum_{i=1}^{q-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{q} 2 \alpha_i \alpha_j
    \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{q-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{q} \left[
      \left(\alpha_i\right)^2 - 2 \alpha_i \alpha_j + \left(\alpha_j\right)^2 
    \right]
    = \sum_{i=1}^{q-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{q} \left(\alpha_i - \alpha_j\right)^2.
  \end{align*}
  Since each term in the last summation is \nonnegative, 
  the entire summation is equal to zero if and only if
  $\alpha_i = \alpha_j$ for all $i,j \in \{1, \dots, q\}$.
\end{proof}

Using \lemref{seq_all_equal},
we can prove the following lemma
on \aggIDs.
\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:cov_info_use}
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 2-edge-connected undirected graph,
  $T$ be a DFS-tree of $G$ rooted at $r \in V$,
  and $uv$ be a tree edge in $T$.
  Moreover,
  let $\Cov(uv) = \{(x_1,y_1), \dots, (x_q,y_q)\}$ be the set of back edges covering $uv$,
  where $q = \CovMult(uv)$.
  Then, the following two conditions hold:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_q$ if and only if
    $\left(\CovDesc{1}(uv)\right)^2 = q \cdot \CovDesc{2}(uv)$; and
  \item $y_1 = y_2 = \cdots = y_q$ if and only if
    $\left(\CovAnc{1}(uv)\right)^2 = q \cdot \CovAnc{2}(uv)$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  The conditions follow directly from \lemref{seq_all_equal}
  by setting
  $\alpha_i := \id(x_i)$ for the descendant-side condition
  and $\alpha_i := \id(y_i)$ for the ancestor-side condition.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Difference-Based Aggregation on a Rooted Tree}
\label{sec:diff_agg}
Let $T$ be a rooted tree.
Each edge $e$ stores a value, say $A(e)$
(from $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{R}$,
or, more generally, from an additive abelian group),
and update operations add a constant value
to all edges on a specified
ancestor--descendant path in $T$.

Formally, update operations are specified by triples $(x, y,\alpha)$,
where $y$ is an ancestor of $x$ in $T$,
and $\alpha$ is a value to be added to all edges on the $x$--$y$ path.
The goal is to compute the final value stored in each edge
after performing a sequence of such update operations.

In order to achieve this goal efficiently,
we use a difference-based approach.
We associate each vertex $v$ in $T$
with an auxiliary value $\Delta(v)$, initially set to zero.
For each update operation $(x,y,\alpha)$,
we perform:
\[
  \plusassign{\Delta(x)}{\alpha},
  \qquad
  \minusassign{\Delta(y)}{\alpha}.
\]

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:diff_agg}
  Let $T$ be a rooted tree and
  each edge $e$ store an initial value $A(e)$.
  After performing a sequence of update operations
  represented as triples $(x,y,\alpha)$ on a rooted tree $T$,
  for each edge $\pi(v)v$, 
  the updated value is given by
  \[
  A(\pi(v)v) + \sum_{w \in V(T_v)} \Delta(w).
  \]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Consider a single update operation $(x,y,\alpha)$.
  By the definition of $\Delta$,
  the operation contributes $+\alpha$ to $\Delta(x)$ and $-\alpha$ to $\Delta(y)$.
  We examine how such an operation contributes to the sum~$\sum_{w \in V(T_v)} \Delta(w)$.

  If $x \in V(T_v)$ and $y \not\in V(T_v)$,
  then the $x$--$y$ path passes through $\pi(v)v$,
  and the operation contributes $+\alpha$ to the sum.
  If both $x$ and $y$ belong to $V(T_v)$,
  then the $x$--$y$ path does not pass through $\pi(v)v$,
  and its $+\alpha$ and $-\alpha$ contributions cancel within $T_v$,
  yielding a total contribution of $0$.
  If neither $x$ nor $y$ is in $T_v$,
  then the $x$--$y$ path does not pass through $\pi(v)v$,
  and again contributes $0$ to the sum.
  Since $y$ is a proper ancestor of $x$,
  the case with $x \not\in V(T_v)$ and $y \in V(T_v)$ cannot occur.

  Therefore, the only update operations that contribute a \nonzero amount are those
  whose $x$--$y$ path passes through $\pi(v)v$,
  and each such operation contributes exactly $+\alpha$.
\end{proof}

      \State $\plusassign{\mathit{value}(\pi(v)v)}{\mathit{value}(vw)}$
    \EndFor
    \EndProcedure
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:diff_agg_algo}
  Given a rooted tree $T$ with $n$ vertices
  and a sequence of $q$ update operations,
  \algoref{diff_agg} computes the final values
  for all edges in $O(q+n)$ time.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  By \lemref{diff_agg},
  it suffices to show that
  \algoref{diff_agg} correctly computes
  $
  A(\pi(v)v) + \sum_{w \in V(T_v)} \Delta(w)
  $
  for each edge $\pi(v)v$.
  % the sum of the auxiliary values $\Delta$ for all vertices in $T_v$.

  We first show the case with $v$ being a leaf.
  In this case, since there is no child of $v$ in $T$,
  % the algorithm returns $A(uv) = \Delta(v)$.
  the algorithm sets $\mathit{value}(\pi(v)v) = A(\pi(v)v) + \Delta(v)$.
  
  Next, we consider the case other than the leaf case. 
  We assume that, for any child $w$ of $v$ in $T$,
  \Call{Aggregate-DFS}{$w$} correctly computes
  the sum of the auxiliary values $\Delta$ for all vertices in $T_w$.
  Then, the algorithm computes
  \[
  A(\pi(v)v) +
  \Delta(v) + \sum_{w \text{:~child of } v} \sum_{z \in V(T_w)} \Delta(z)
  = A(\pi(v)v) + \sum_{z \in V(T_v)} \Delta(z)
  \]
  that is the sum of the auxiliary values $\Delta$ for all vertices in $T_v$.

  Since each update operation is processed in constant time,
  the total time for all $q$ update operations is $O(q)$.
  We visit each vertex exactly once,
  and consider all edges exactly once,
  which means we can correctly compute the final values for all edges.
  Since we traverse only edges in $T$,
  we can execute the aggregation in $O(n)$ time.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Computation of Cover Information}
\label{sec:cov_info_agg}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 2-edge-connected undirected graph 
and $T$ be a DFS-tree of $G$ rooted at $r \in V$.
As described in \secref{prel_dfs},
every back edge $(x,y)$ is oriented from a descendant $x$ to a proper ancestor $y$.

Each back edge $(x,y)$ covers
all tree edges on the unique $y$--$x$ path in $T$.
Therefore, we have a natural mapping from back edges
to an update opeation $(x,y,\alpha)$ on $T$,
where $\alpha$ is chosen appropriately depending on the quantity to be computed.

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:cov_info_agg}
  Given a 2-edge-connected undirected graph $G=(V,E)$
  with $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$,
  and a DFS-tree $T$ of $G$ rooted at $r \in V$,
  we can compute the following quantities for all tree edges in $T$
  in $O(n+m)$ time:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Cover multiplicity $\CovMult(uv)$;
  % \item Cover-source multiplicity $\CovSrc(uv)$;
  \item \AggIDs{}$\CovDesc{1}(uv)$ and $\CovDesc{2}(uv)$; and
  \item \AggIDs{}$\CovAnc{1}(uv)$ and $\CovAnc{2}(uv)$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  By the definiton of each quantity,
  we can represent the contribution of each back edge $(x,y)$
  as an update operation $(x,y,\alpha)$ on $T$,
  where $\alpha$ is set as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For $\CovMult(uv)$, set $\alpha := 1$;
  % \item For $\CovSrc(uv)$, set $\alpha := 1$ if $(x, y) = \lbe(x)$; otherwise, set $\alpha := 0$;
  \item For $\CovDesc{i}(uv)$, set $\alpha := \left(\id(x)\right)^i$ for $i \in \{1, 2\}$; and
  \item For $\CovAnc{i}(uv)$, set $\alpha := \left(\id(y)\right)^i$ for $i \in \{1, 2\}$.
  \end{itemize}
  Since there are $O(m)$ back edges in $G$,
  we can perform $O(m)$ update operations on $T$.
  By \lemref{diff_agg_algo},
  we can compute the final values for all tree edges in $O(n+m)$ time.

% \section{Computation of Cover multiplicities}
% \label{sec:cov_mult}
% In this section, we present an $O(n+m)$-time algorithm
% to compute the cover multiplicity and the cover-source multiplicity
% for all tree edges in a 2-edge-connected undirected graph $G=(V,E)$
% with $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$.

% Since the two multiplicities can be computed in a similar manner,
% we here describe the algorithm for computing the cover multiplicities;
% the cover-source multiplicities can be computed with a minor modification
% as described at the end of this section.

% In this section, we assume that a DFS-tree $T$ of $G$,
% rooted at an arbitrary vertex $r \in V$, is already given.
% The algorithm consists of two phases.
% In the first phase, we process each back edge to update an auxiliary
% value called \emph{cover-delta value} associated with its endpoints.
% %(Algorithm~\ref{alg:preproc_backedge}).
% In the second phase, we traverse $T$ in a depth-first manner to aggregate these values
% along the tree and compute the multiplicity for each tree edge
% (Algorithm~\ref{alg:cov_mult}).
% % The details are described below.

% In order to compute the cover multiplicities,
% we define the \emph{cover-delta value} $\delta(v)$ for each vertex $v \in V$ as follows:
% \[
% \delta(v)
% \triangleq \big| \{(v,y) \mid (v,y) \text{ is a back edge}\} \big| - \big| \{(x,v) \mid (x,v) \text{ is a back edge}\} \big|.
% \]
% Equivalently, 
% if we orient all back edges from descendants to ancestors as described in \secref{prel_dfs}
% and remove all tree edges,
% then $\delta(v)$ equals the outdegree minus the indegree of $v$ in the resulting directed graph.
% The cover-delta values satisfy a fundamental relation with the cover
% multiplicity, which we show below.

% \begin{lem}
%   \label{lem:delta_cov}
%   For any tree edge $(u,v)$ of $G$,
%   the cover multiplicity of $(u,v)$ is equal to the sum of
%   the cover-delta values for all vertices in $T_v$:
%   \[
%   \CovMult(uv) = \sum_{w \in V(T_v)} \delta(w).
%   \]
% \end{lem}
% \begin{proof}
%   By the definition of $\delta$,
%   every back edge $(x,y)$ contributes $+1$ to $\delta(x)$ and $-1$ to $\delta(y)$.
%   We examine how such a back edge contributes to the sum~$\sum_{w \in V(T_v)} \delta(w)$.

%   If $x \in V(T_v)$ and $y \not\in V(T_v)$,
%   then $(x,y)$ covers $uv$ and contributes $+1$ to the sum.
%   If both $x$ and $y$ belong to $V(T_v)$,
%   then $(x,y)$ does not cover $uv$ and
%   its $+1$ and $-1$ contributions cancel within $T_v$,
%   yielding a total contribution of $0$.
%   If neither $x$ nor $y$ is in $T_v$,
%   then $(x,y)$ does not cover $uv$ and again contributes $0$ to the sum.
%   Since $y$ is a proper ancestor of $x$,
%   the case with $x \not\in V(T_v)$ and $y \in V(T_v)$ cannot occur.

%   Therefore, the only back edges that contribute a \nonzero amount are those
%   that cover $uv$,
%   and each such edge contributes exactly $+1$.
% \end{proof}

% In order to compute the cover-delta values for all vertices in $V$,
% we can process each back edge $(x,y)$ of $G$
% and increment $\delta(x)$ by 1 and decrement $\delta(y)$ by 1.
% This can be done in $O(n+m)$ time
% by performing a DFS on $G$ to obtain its DFS-tree $T$
% and then processing all back edges of $G$.

% The second phase computes the cover multiplicities for all tree edges
% by aggregating the cover-delta values along the DFS-tree $T$.
% The details are shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:cov_mult}.

% % \item Execute Algorithm~\ref{alg:cov_mult} with the tree edge
% %   incident to the root $r$ to compute the cover multiplicities
% %   for all tree edges in $T$.
% % \end{enumerate}


% \begin{lem}
%   \label{lem:cov_mult}
%   Given a 2-edge-connected undirected graph $G=(V,E)$
%   with $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$,
%   its DFS-tree $T$ rooted at $r \in V$, and 
%   the cover-delta values $\delta$ for all vertices in $V$,
%   Algorithm~\ref{alg:cov_mult} computes the cover multiplicities
%   for all tree edges in $O(n)$ time.
% \end{lem}
% \begin{proof}
%   By \lemref{delta_cov},
%   it suffices to show that
%   Algorithm~\ref{alg:cov_mult} correctly computes
%   the sum of the cover-delta values for all vertices in $T_v$.

%   We first show the case with $v$ being a leaf.
%   In this case, since there is no child of $v$ in $T$,
%   the algorithm returns $\CovMult(uv) = \delta(v)$.
  
%   Next, we consider the case other than the leaf case. 
%   We assume that, for any child $w$ of $v$ in $T$,
%   \Call{CoverMultiplicity-DFS}{$w$} correctly computes
%   the sum of the cover-delta values for all vertices in $T_w$.
%   Then, the algorithm computes
%   \[
%   \delta(v) + \sum_{w \text{:~child of } v} \sum_{z \in V(T_w)} \delta(z)
%   = \sum_{z \in V(T_v)} \delta(z)
%   \]
%   that is the sum of the cover-delta values for all vertices in $T_v$.

%   We visit each vertex exactly once,
%   and consider all tree edges exactly once,
%   which means we can correctly compute the cover multiplicities for all tree edges.
%   Since we traverse only tree edges in $T$,
%   we can execute the algorithm in $O(n)$ time.
% \end{proof}

% % If we want to compute the cover-source multiplicities,
% % we can modify Algorithm~\ref{alg:preproc_backedge}
% % so that, in line \ref{codeline:backedge_loop} of Algorithm~\ref{alg:preproc_backedge},
% % we only consider the longest back edges outgoing from each vertex.
% To compute the cover-source multiplicities,
% we modify the definition of the cover-delta value so that
% it accounts only for the longest outgoing back edges.
% We define the \emph{cover-source-delta} value $\delta_{\text{src}}(v)$
% to be
% \[
% \delta_{\text{src}}(v)
% \triangleq
% \left.\begin{cases}
% 1 & \text{if } \lbe(v) \text{ exists} \\
% 0 & \text{otherwise}
% \end{cases}
% \right\}
% % \big| \{\lbeTarget(x) \mid \lbe(x) \text{ exists}\} \big|
% - \big| \{x \in V \mid \lbe(x) = (x,v)\} \big|.
% \]
% Equivalently,
% if we orient only the longest back edges from descendants to ancestors
% and remove all the other edges,
% then $\delta_{\text{src}}(v)$ equals the outdegree minus the indegree of $v$ in the resulting directed graph.
% Then, by a similar argument to \lemref{delta_cov},
% we can show that
% \[
% \CovSrc(uv) = \sum_{w \in V(T_v)} \delta_{\text{src}}(w).
% \]
% Thus, by replacing $\delta$ with $\delta_{\text{src}}$ in Algorithm~\ref{alg:cov_mult},
% we can compute the cover-source multiplicities for all tree edges.


% Therefore, we obtain the following theorem that 
% \engvariation{summarises}{summarizes} the results in this section.

% \begin{thm}
%   \label{thm:cov_mult}
%   Given a 2-edge-connected undirected graph $G=(V,E)$
%   with $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$,
%   we can compute the cover multiplicity and the cover-source multiplicity
%   for all tree edges in $G$ in $O(n+m)$ time.
% \end{thm}
% \begin{proof}
%   We first perform a DFS on $G$ to obtain its DFS-tree $T$
%   rooted at an arbitrary vertex $r \in V$ in $O(n+m)$ time.
%   Next, we process all back edges of $T$
%   to compute the cover-delta values~$\delta$ or cover-source-delta values~$\delta_{\text{src}}$ for all vertices in $V$ in $O(n+m)$ time.
%   Finally, we execute Algorithm~\ref{alg:cov_mult}
%   with each tree edge $(r, v)$ incident to the root $r$
%   to compute the cover multiplicities for all tree edges in $T$.
%   By \lemref{cov_mult},
%   this step takes $O(n)$ time.
%   Thus, the total time complexity is $O(n+m)$.

\section{Mathematical Properties and Computation of Minimal Removable Sets}
\label{sec:mrs_props}
In this section, we study structural properties of MinRSs
and present an efficient algorithm for computing all MinRSs
in a 2-edge-connected undirected graph.
% In \secref{mrs_props},


MinRSs in a 2-edge-connected undirected graph
have been studied in \cite{ISYH.2022,TH.2025}.
In these works, they showed the following necessary condition for MinRSs.
\begin{lem}[Observation 3 in \cite{ISYH.2022} and Lemma 7 in \cite{TH.2025}]
  \label{lem:mrs_cond}
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 2-edge-connected undirected graph with $|V|\geq 3$.
  If a \nonempty proper subset $S \subsetneq V$ is a MinRS of $G$,
  then,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $S$ forms a \maxTwoDegPath in $G$;
  or
  \item $S$ is a singleton $\{v\}$, where $v \in V$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lem}
By \lemref{mrs_cond},
we can list all candidates for MinRSs in $O(n+m)$ time
by finding all \maxTwoDegPaths in $G$
and collecting all singleton vertex sets.

Based on \lemref{mrs_cond},
we classify MinRSs into several types
to make them easier to handle with a DFS-tree $T$ of $G$ rooted at an arbitrary vertex $r \in V$:
\begin{itemize}
\item the MinRS containing the root of the DFS-tree;
\item MinRSs containing at least one leaf of the DFS-tree;
\item MinRSs consisting only of internal vertices of the DFS-tree that form a \maxTwoDegPath in $G$; and
\item MinRSs consisting of a single internal vertex of the DFS-tree with degree at least three in $G$.
\end{itemize}

The MinRS containing the root of the DFS-tree
contains no leaf of the DFS-tree;
this \categorisation is mutually exclusive.
% Moreover,
% if $r$ is contained in some MinRS,
% then it is the only such MinRS in $G$:
% $\{r\}$ if $\deg_G(r) \geq 3$ or a \maxTwoDegPath containing $r$ otherwise.


\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:mrs_root}
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 2-edge-connected undirected graph with $|V|\geq 3$
  and $T$ be a DFS-tree of $G$ rooted at $r\in V$.
  We can determine whether $G$ has a MinRS containing $r$
  and find such a MinRS in $O(n+m)$ time.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  By \lemref{mrs_cond},
  if $G$ has a MinRS containing $r$,
  then it is either $\{r\}$ (if $\deg_G(r) \geq 3$) or a \maxTwoDegPath~$P$ containing $r$ (otherwise).
  All we have to do is to check $G - r$ or $G - P$ for 2-edge-connectivity, which can be done in $O(n+m)$ time.
\end{proof}

In the rest of this section,
we focus on MinRSs that do not contain the root of the DFS-tree.
% Before going into details,
% leaf, and \maxTwoDegPathの章で議論を簡単にするために
% rootをふくない pathなどの性質を述べる
Before going into details,
we show a basic property of \maxTwoDegPaths not containing the root of the DFS-tree
for the sake of simplifying discussions in the following subsections.
\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:max2degpath_props}
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 2-edge-connected undirected graph with $|V|\geq 3$,
  $T$ be a DFS-tree of $G$ rooted at $r\in V$, and
  Let $P = v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v_k$
  be a \maxTwoDegPath in $G$ that does not contain $r$.
  Then, the following hold:
  \begin{enumerate}[label={\rm(\roman*)}]
  \item
  No internal vertex of $T$
  that is an endpoint of any back edge
  appears in $P$; and
  \item The sequence $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k$ appears in this order or its reverse order
  on a root-to-leaf path in $T$.
  \item % P に Tのleaf が現れるなら, それは v1 か vk であり、一方のみである
  If $P$ contains a leaf of $T$,
  then it is either $v_1$ or $v_k$, but not both.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  (i)
  Since every internal vertex of $T$ has the parent and at least one child,
  if an internal vertex of $T$ is an endpoint of some back edge,
  then the degree in $G$ is at least three.
  Thus, such a vertex cannot appear in $P$.
  \newline
  (ii)
  In the DFS traversal that constructs $T$,
  the vertices in $P$ are visited one by one
  without visiting any other vertex in between.
  % \newline
  (iii) is immediate from (ii).
\end{proof}

\subsection{MinRSs Containing DFS-Tree Leaf}
\label{sec:leaf_mrs}
In this subsection, we consider MinRSs that consist of only leaves of a DFS-tree.

We first show a basic property of leaves in a DFS-tree
of a 2-edge-connected undirected graph.
\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:leaf_not_ap}
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 2-edge-connected undirected graph with $|V|\geq 3$
  and
  $T$ be a DFS-tree of $G$ rooted at $r\in V$.
  % Any leaf of $T$ is not an articulation point of $G$.
  % leaf or Max2degpath containing leaf は 削除しても連結性を保つ
  For any leaf $v\in V$ of $T$ or any \maxTwoDegPath~$P$ containing a leaf of $T$,
  $G - v$ or $G - P$ is connected.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Since $T$ is a spanning tree of $G$,
  every path in $T$ also exists in $G$.
  For any leaf $v\in V$ of $T$ or any \maxTwoDegPath~$P$ containing a leaf of $T$,
  $T - v$ or $T - P$ is connected.
  Thus, $G - v$ or $G - P$ is also connected.
\end{proof}

% \begin{lem}
%   \label{lem:leaf_mrs}
%   Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 2-edge-connected undirected graph with $|V|\geq 3$ and,
%   $T$ be a DFS-tree of $G$ rooted at $r\in V$.
%   For each leaf $v$, $\{v\}$ is a MinRS of $G$ if and only if
%   the following two conditions hold:
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item[\rm (i)] $\pi(v)$ has degree at least 3 in $G$; and
%   % \item[\rm (ii)] for any back edge $vu$,
%   % any tree edge on the $u,\pi(v)$-path in $T$ is covered by
%   % some back edge outgoing from other vertex than $v$. 
%   \item[\rm (ii)] let $\lbe(v)=(v,u^*)$,
%     then, for any tree edge $(x,y)$ on the $u^*,\pi(v)$-path in $T$,
%     there exists a back edge outgoing from a vertex in $T_y - v$
%     that covers $(x,y)$.
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{lem}
% \begin{proof}
%   ($\Longrightarrow$)
%   We show by contraposition.
%   Suppose that either (i) or (ii) does not hold.
%   If (i) does not hold, then
%   $\pi(v)$ has degree 1 in $G - v$,
%   which means that $G - v$ is not 2-edge-connected.
%   If (ii) does not hold,
%   then there exists a tree edge $(x,y)$ on the $u^*,\pi(v)$-path in $T$
%   that is not covered by any back edge outgoing from other vertex than $v$.
%   Since any vertex in $T_y - v$ cannot have a back edge to
%   a proper ancestor of $x$ in $G - v$,
%   which means that $xy$ is a bridge in $G - v$.
%   Thus, in either case, $G - v$ is not 2-edge-connected.
  
%   % \medskip
%   ($\Longleftarrow$)
%   We suffice to show that $G - v$ is 2-edge-connected.
%   By \lemref{leaf_not_ap},
%   $G - v$ is connected.
%   We show that there is no bridge in $G - v$.
%   Every back edge $(x, y)$ with $x, y \neq v$ is not a bridge in $G - v$,
%   since $xy$ and the $y,x$-path in $T$ form a cycle in $G - v$.
%   Next, we consider tree edges in $G - v$.
%   For any tree edge not on the $u^*,\pi(v)$-path in $T$,
%   the covering back edge still exists in $G - v$,
%   which means that such a tree edge is not a bridge in $G - v$.
%   For any tree edge $(x,y)$ on the $u^*,\pi(v)$-path in $T$,
%   by (ii),
%   there exists a back edge outgoing from a vertex in $T_y - v$
%   that covers $(x,y)$,
%   which means that such a tree edge is not a bridge in $G - v$.
%   Thus, there is no bridge in $G - v$,
%   and hence, $G - v$ is 2-edge-connected.
% \end{proof}


\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:leaf_mrs}
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 2-edge-connected undirected graph with $|V|\geq 3$ and
  $T$ be a DFS-tree of $G$ rooted at $r\in V$.
  Let $S \subsetneq V$ be 
  a nonempty proper subset of $V$ that
  is either a singleton consisting of a leaf of $T$
  or a \maxTwoDegPath containing a leaf of $T$;
  let $x$ denote the leaf of $T$ in $S$ and
  $a$ denote the other endpoint of $S$.
  Note that $a = x$ if $S$ is a singleton.
  Then, $S$ is a MinRS of $G$ if and only if,
  for any tree edge $(u,v)$ with $v \not\in S$,
  there exists a back edge outgoing from some vertex in $\diffset{V}{S}$
  that covers $(u,v)$.  
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  By \lemref{max2degpath_props},
  $S$ contains exactly one leaf of $T$ and
  $S$ appears as a path from some vertex~$a$ to its descendant~$x$ in $T$.
  (If $S$ is a singleton, then $a = x$.)
  By the definition of $S$, $x$ is a leaf of $T$.
  Since $G$ is 2-edge-connected,
  every tree edge is covered by at least one back edge.
  Thus, it suffices to consider only tree edges on the $y$--$\pi(a)$ path in $T$,
  where $y$ is the most distant proper ancestor of $x$
  adjacent to $x$ by a back edge.
  \newline
  ($\Longrightarrow$)
  We show by contraposition.
  Suppose that there exists a tree edge $(u,v)$ on the $y$--$\pi(a)$ path in $T$
  that is not covered by any back edge outgoing from a vertex  other than those in $S$.
  Any vertex in $T_v - S$ cannot have a back edge to
  a proper ancestor of $u$ in $G - S$,
  which means that $uv$ is a bridge in $G - S$.
  \newline
  ($\Longleftarrow$)
  By \lemref{mrs_cond},
  it suffices to show that $G - S$ is 2-edge-connected.
  By \lemref{leaf_not_ap},
  $G - S$ is connected.
  We show that there is no bridge in $G - S$.
  Every back edge $(x', y') \in \diffset{E}{E(T)}$
  with $x', y' \not\in S$ is not a bridge in $G - S$,
  since $x'y'$ and the $y'$--$x'$ path in $T$ form a cycle in $G - S$.
  Next, we consider tree edges in $G - S$.
  For any tree edge not on the $y$--$\pi(a)$-path in $T$,
  no covering back edge disappears by removing $S$ from $G$,
  % still exists in $G - S$,
  which means that such a tree edge is not a bridge in $G - S$.
  For any tree edge $(u, v)$ on the $y$--$\pi(a)$-path in $T$,
  by the assumption,
  there exists a back edge outgoing from a vertex in $T_v - S$
  that covers $(u,v)$,
  which means that such a tree edge is not a bridge in $G - S$.
  Thus, there is no bridge in $G - S$,
  and hence, $G - S$ is 2-edge-connected.
\end{proof}


% Here, we introduce the \emph{source-exclusive coverage set}~$\SrcExc_v$ of each vertex $v \in V$,
% defined to be the set of tree edge $e$ in $T$ such that
% $\CovSrc(e) = 1$ and $e$ is covered by
% only back edges outgoing from $v$.
% Or equivalently,
% if $e \in \SrcExc_v$,
% then $e$ is covered by back edges outgoing from $v$,
% and no back edge outgoing from any other vertex covers $e$.
% Any tree edge in $\SrcExc_v$ must be on the $\lbeTarget(v)$--$\pi(v)$ path in $T$.

% By \lemref{leaf_mrs},
% $S$ is a MinRS of $G$ if and only if,
% tree edges (u,v) with v notin S
% covering back edge (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (xk,yk)
% → x1 != x or x2 != x or ... or xk != x
Let $S \subsetneq V$ be 
a nonempty proper subset of $V$ that
is either a singleton consisting of a leaf of $T$
or a \maxTwoDegPath containing a leaf of $T$;
let $x$ denote the leaf of $T$.
Since $x$ is the only vertex in $S$ that has back edges outgoing from it, then by \lemref{leaf_mrs},
$S$ is a MinRS of $G$ if and only if,
for any tree edge $(u,v)$ with $v \not\in S$,
there exists a back edge outgoing from other vertex than $x$
that covers $(u,v)$.

\begin{thm}
  \label{thm:leaf_mrs}
  Given a 2-edge-connected undirected graph $G=(V,E)$
  with $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$,
  \algoref{leaf_mrs} computes all MinRSs of $G$ containing a leaf of a DFS-tree $T$
  in $O(n+m)$ time.
  % we can compute all MinRSs containing a leaf of a DFS-tree $T$
  % in $O(n+m)$ time.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Note that we assume that a graph has no parallel edges throughout this paper.
  If $|V| < 3$, i.e., $G$ consists of only one vertex,
  then $G$ has no MinRS.
  Thus, we assume that $|V| \geq 3$.
  As the given graph is 2-edge-connected,
  each tree edge is covered by at least one back edge.
  Let $S \subsetneq V$ be 
  a nonempty proper subset of $V$ that
  is either a singleton consisting of a leaf of $T$
  or a \maxTwoDegPath containing a leaf of $T$;
  let $x$ denote the leaf of $T$ in $S$.
  By the discussion before the theorem,
  $S$ is a MinRS of $G$ if and only if,
  for any tree edge $(u,v)$ with $v \not\in S$,
  there exists a back edge outgoing from other vertex than $x$
  that covers $(u,v)$;
  which is equivalent to that
  for any tree edge $(u,v)$ with $v \not\in S$,
  $X_{uv}=\{x' \in V \mid \text{There is back edge $(x', y')$ covering $(u,v)$} \} \neq \{x\}$ holds.
  By \lemref{cov_info_agg},
  we can compute the \aggIDs
  $\CovDesc{1}$ and $\CovDesc{2}$
  for all tree edges.

  By \lemref{cov_info_agg},
  we can compute $\CovDesc{1}$ and $\CovDesc{2}$
  for all tree edges in $O(n+m)$ time.
  For each tree edge $(u,v)$,
  we can compute the set
  $X_{uv}$ from $\CovDesc{1}(uv)$ and $\CovDesc{2}(uv)$
  in constant time.
  For each leaf $l$ of $T$,
  we can check whether $S$ is a MinRS of $G$
  in time proportional to the size of $\mathit{covering\_sets}_l$.
  Since the total size of $\mathit{covering\_sets}_l$
  for all leaves $l$ of $T$ is at most $O(n)$,
  we can check all candidates $S$ in $O(n)$ time.
  Thus, the total time complexity is $O(n+m)$.
\end{proof}

% Max2deg Path MinRSs but all vertices are internal vertices of DFS-tree
\subsection{\MaxTwoDegPathCap MinRSs but all Internal Vertices}
\label{sec:max2deg_pathcap_mrs}
In this section, we consider MinRSs that consist of only internal vertices of a DFS-tree
and form a \maxTwoDegPath in $G$.
% In order to simplify discussions,
% we introduce the `suppression' for \maxTwoDegPaths.
% %そのために a != b であることを示す

% 議論を簡単にするために, max2degpath の suppression を導入する
% そのために, a != b であることを示す
To simplify discussions,
we introduce the \emph{suppression} for \maxTwoDegPaths.
First, we show that the two \neighbours of the endpoints of a \maxTwoDegPath
not containing the root or any leaf of a DFS-tree are distinct.
\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:suppression_valid}
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 2-edge-connected undirected graph with $|V|\geq 3$,
  and $P$ be a \maxTwoDegPath in $G$ that does not contain the root or any leaf of a DFS-tree $T$ of $G$.
  Then, $|N_G(V(P))| = 2$ holds.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $P = v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v_k$,
  and let $a, b$ denote the \neighbours of $v_1$ and $v_k$ not on $P$ if $P$ is not a singleton;
  if $P$ is a singleton, then let $a$ and $b$ denote the two \neighbours of the only vertex in $P$.
  We show that $a \neq b$ holds.
  By \lemref{max2degpath_props}(ii), 
  $P$ appears as the $v_1$--$v_k$ path in $T$,
  and without loss of generality,
  we assume that $v_1$ is an ancestor of $v_k$ in $T$.
  The DFS traversal visits in order $a, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k$.
  If $a = b$, then
  $v_k b$ is a back edge,
  which means that $b$ would be a leaf of $T$
  since $v_k$ has degree 2 and $b$ is its only neighbour other than $v_{k-1}$.
  This contradicts the assumption that $P$ does not contain any leaf of $T$.
\end{proof}

We fix a \maxTwoDegPath~$P = v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v_k$ in $G$, and let $\{a, b\} = N_G(V(P))$,
where $a \neq b$ holds by \lemref{suppression_valid}.
We define the \emph{suppression} of $P$
to be the graph $G_P$ obtained from $G$ by
removing all vertices of $P$
and adding a new edge $e_P=ab$,
which means that the new edge $e_P$ is not a self-loop.
Note that $G_P$ or the suppressed DFS-tree $T_P$ may have parallel edges even if $G$ has no parallel edges.

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:dfs_tree_suppression}
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 2-edge-connected undirected graph with $|V|\geq 3$,
  $T$ be a DFS-tree of $G$ rooted at $r\in V$,
  and $P = v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v_k$ be a \maxTwoDegPath in $G$ that does not contain $r$ or any leaf of $T$;
  let $a$ and $b$ denote the \neighbours of $v_1$ and $v_k$ not on $P$.
  Then, $T_P$ is a DFS-tree of $G_P$ rooted at $r$,
  where $T_P$ is the tree obtained from $T$ by surpressing $P$.
  Moreover,
  $e_P$ is a tree edge in $T_P$ and
  $\CovMult(e_P)$ in $G_P$ equals any $\CovMult(uv)$ in $G$
  for a tree edge $(u,v)$ on the $a$--$b$ path in $T$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $P = v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v_k$,
  and let $a, b$ denote the \neighbours of $v_1$ and $v_k$ not on $P$.
  By Lemmas~\ref{lem:max2degpath_props}(ii) and~\ref{lem:suppression_valid},
  $P$ appears as the $v_1$--$v_k$ path in $T$,
  and without loss of generality,
  we assume that $v_1$ is an ancestor of $v_k$ in $T$.
  In the DFS traversal that constructs $T$,
  the vertices in order $a, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k, b$ are visited one by one
  without visiting any other vertex in between.
  For DFS traversal on $G_P$,
  when we visit $a$,
  we can directly visit $b$ via the new edge $e_P = ab$
  without visiting any other vertex in between.
  Thus, $T_P$ is a DFS-tree of $G_P$ rooted at $r$.
  \newline
  By the construction of $T_P$,
  $e_P$ is a tree edge in $T_P$.
  Next, we show that
  $\CovMult(e_P)$ in $G_P$ equals any $\CovMult(uv)$ in $G$
  for a tree edge $(u,v)$ on the $a$--$b$ path in $T$.
  No vertex in $P$ is an endpoint of any back edge by \lemref{max2degpath_props}(i).
  Thus, any back edge in $G$ corresponds to a back edge in $G_P$ and vice versa.
  Moreover,
  a back edge covers $e_P$ in $G_P$
  if and only if it covers any tree edge $(u,v)$ on the $a$--$b$ path in $T$ in $G$.
  Thus, the cover multiplicities are equal.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:2edgecut_covmult}
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 2-edge-connected undirected (multi)graph with $|V|\geq 3$,
  $T$ be a DFS-tree of $G$ rooted at $r\in V$, and
  $e=(u, v)$ be a tree edge in $T$.
  Then, $e$ belongs to some 2-edge-cut if and only if
  $\CovMult(e) = 1$ in $G$.
  Moreover, if $e$ belongs to some 2-edge-cut,
  then there exists a unique tree edge $f \neq e$ such that
  $E(V(T_v)) = \{e,f\}$ holds.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $X := V(T_v)$.
  ($\Longrightarrow$)
  Let $\{e, f\}$ be a 2-edge-cut containing $e$ for some tree edge $f \neq e$.
  In $G - e$,
  $X$ and $\diffset{V}{X}$ are connected separately.
  Since $G - \{e, f\}$ is disconnected,
  the connected components of $G - \{e, f\}$ are exactly $X$ and $\diffset{V}{X}$.
  Thus, $f$ is the only back edge covering $e$ in $G$,
  which means that $\CovMult(e) = 1$.
  \newline
  ($\Longleftarrow$)
  Suppose that $\CovMult(e) = 1$.
  Let $f$ be the unique back edge covering $e$ in $G$.
  In $G - e$,
  $X$ and $\diffset{V}{X}$ are connected separately.
  Since $f$ is the only back edge covering $e$,
  $G - \{e, f\}$ is disconnected.
  Thus, $\{e, f\}$ is a 2-edge-cut containing $e$.
  \newline
  Moreover,
  if $e$ belongs to some 2-edge-cut,
  then the above argument shows that
  there exists a unique tree edge $f \neq e$ such that
  $E_G(V(T_v)) = \{e,f\}$ holds.
\end{proof}



\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:max2degpath_mrs}
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 2-edge-connected undirected graph with $|V|\geq 3$,
  $T$ be a DFS-tree of $G$ rooted at $r\in V$,
  and $P$ be a \maxTwoDegPath in $G$ that does not contain $r$ or any leaf of $T$.
  The following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}[label={\rm(\roman*)}]
    \item $P$ is a MinRS of $G$;
    \item $G_P - e_P$ is 2-edge-connected; and
    \item $\CovMult(e_P) \geq 2$ in $G_P$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  The equivalence between
  (i) and (ii) is immediate from the definition of MinRSs
  and the construction of $G_P$.
  \newline
  (ii) $\iff$ $G_P - e_P$ has no bridge $\iff$
  $G_P$ has no 2-edge-cut containing $e_P$
  $\iff$ (iii),
  where the last equivalence follows by \lemref{2edgecut_covmult}.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
  \label{thm:max2degpath_mrs}
  Given a 2-edge-connected undirected graph $G=(V,E)$
  with $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$,
  and its DFS-tree $T$ rooted at $r \in V$,
  we can compute all MinRSs of $G$ consisting of only internal vertices of $T$
  that form a \maxTwoDegPath in $G$
  in $O(n+m)$ time.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Let $P$ be a \maxTwoDegPath in $G$ that does not contain $r$ or any leaf of $T$
  and $v$ denote the vertex in $P$ closest to $r$ in $T$.
  By Lemmas~\ref{lem:dfs_tree_suppression} and~\ref{lem:max2degpath_mrs},
  we can determine whether $P$ is a MinRS of $G$
  by checking whether $\CovMult(\pi(v)v) \geq 2$ in $G_P$.
  By \lemref{cov_info_agg},
  we can compute the cover multiplicities for all tree edges in $O(n+m)$ time.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Single Internal Vertex Degree At Least 3 MinRSs}
\label{sec:single_vertex_deg3_mrs}

\begin{lem}
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 2-edge-connected undirected graph with $|V|\geq 3$ and $v \in V$.
  The graph $G - v$ has a bridge $e$ if and only if
  there exists $X \subsetneq \diffset{V}{\{v\}}$ such that
  $E_G(X) = \{e\} \cup E_G(v, X)$. 
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  ($\Longrightarrow$)
  Let $X$ be the vertex set of a connected component of $(G - v) - e$, where $E_{G - v}(X) = \{e\}$ holds.
  Since $G$ is connected,
  all edges between $X$ and $\diffset{V}{X}$ in $G$ must be incident to $v$.
  Thus, $E_G(X) = \{e\} \cup E_G(v, X)$ holds.
  \newline
  ($\Longleftarrow$)
  Suppose that there exists $X \subsetneq \diffset{V}{\{v\}}$ such that $E_G(X) = \{e\} \cup E_G(v, X)$.
  In $G - v$, all edges between $X$ and $\diffset{V}{X}$ are removed except for $e$.
  Thus, $e$ is a bridge in $G - v$.
